# Swarmathon-CSU
Swarmathon code repository for Coppin State University

The repository contains algorithms for the 2017 NASA Swarmathon Competition.
The algorithms incorporates several libraries for the Swarmie robots that facilitates the operation of lower-level functionality onboard the physical robot.Â  
The Coppin State University students worked in groups to handle different aspect of the project. 
Students looked at the various ways of ant-foraging and tried to find efficient paths for the rovers to collect April tags. 
This repository contains:

  1. Code for ROS libraries (i.e. packages) that control different aspects of the Swarmie robot, including localization, mapping, mobility, and obstacle and target detection.
  2. 3D .STL models for the physical Swarmie build.
  3. Bash shell scripts for initializing simulated Swarmies in the Gazebo simulator, as well as physical Swarmies.
  
Although the algorithms have been tested, error might still exist. 
Future improvements must focus on writing efficient search algorithms by taking into consideration on how ant foraging works and finding out the best way to achieve the same results in the algorithms.
